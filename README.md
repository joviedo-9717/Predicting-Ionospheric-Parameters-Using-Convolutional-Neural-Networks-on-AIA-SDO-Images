# Predicting-Ionospheric-Parameters-Using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-on-AIA-SDO-Images
This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to predict ionospheric parameters, including F10.7 solar flux, Dst index, Kp index, and sunspot number, based on full-disk solar images from NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). The model processes image data and correlates it with ionospheric measurements obtained from the OMNIWeb NASA database. The repository includes the datasets, Python scripts for building and training the CNN, image preprocessing tools, and visualization scripts that graph the prediction results. This work demonstrates the potential of deep learning in space weather prediction and the analysis of solar–ionospheric interactions.
